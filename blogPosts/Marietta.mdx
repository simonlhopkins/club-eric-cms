Marietta were a four-piece emo/indie/punk band from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania that formed in 2011 and broke up at the end of 2015. They are sad jams inc., kind of like their fellow Philly friends Modern Baseball. Name a feeling, Marietta's got a song to relate to for it. Not only did they craft some great and catchy lyrics, they wrote some incredible songs as well. Two full-lengths, an EP, a split, and a demo were all it took to establish this band as awesome. If you dig Grown Ups, Brave Bird, RVIVR, or Modern Baseball, you will definitely be into Marietta. Enjoy.
